# 🌤️ Weather Dashboard with Power BI, API Integration & Figma Design

## Project Overview

This project is a **visually interactive weather monitoring dashboard** built using **Power BI**. It delivers real-time weather insights like temperature, humidity, air quality, and forecast for Indian cities including **Delhi**, **Bengaluru**, and **Ajmer**. The dashboard features a **custom UI designed in Figma** and integrates **live data via Weather API**—showcasing the power of data storytelling and design.



## Purpose

- To demonstrate the use of **real-time data integration** in Power BI  
- To apply **data transformation and modeling** using Power Query and DAX  
- To highlight **storytelling with data** through visuals and layout  
- To create a **portfolio-ready project** suitable for interviews and business demos

## Tech Stack & Tools Used

- **Power BI** – For dashboard creation and interactive visualizations  
- **DAX** – For calculated measures and KPIs  
- **Power Query (M Language)** – For data transformation and cleaning  
- **Weather API** – Provides live weather and AQI data (in JSON)  
- **Figma** – For custom background and modern UI layout  
- **JSON Parsing** – For converting raw API data into structured tables

## Data Source

- **Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or similar)**  
  Provides:
  - Real-time temperature & conditions
  - 7-day weather forecast
  - Air quality index (PM10, PM2.5, CO, SO2, O3, etc.)
  - Humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility
  - Rain probability
  - Sunrise & sunset times
